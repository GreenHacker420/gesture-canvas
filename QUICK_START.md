# Gesture Canvas - Quick Start Guide

Welcome to Gesture Canvas! This guide will help you get started with creating digital art using hand gestures.

## Getting Started

1. **Open the Application**: Visit [https://greenhacker420.github.io/gesture-canvas/](https://greenhacker420.github.io/gesture-canvas/) in your web browser.

2. **Allow Camera Access**: When prompted, allow the application to access your webcam. This is required for hand tracking.

3. **Position Yourself**: Sit or stand at a comfortable distance from your webcam (approximately 1-2 feet away).

4. **Check Lighting**: Ensure your hands are well-lit for better detection.

## Basic Controls

### Hand Gestures

The application recognizes the following hand gestures:

1. **Draw** (Index finger extended): Point your index finger at the screen while keeping other fingers closed.

2. **Select Color** (Three fingers extended): Extend your index, middle, and ring fingers to activate color selection mode. Move your hand horizontally to select different colors.

3. **Erase** (Two fingers extended): Extend your index and middle fingers to activate the eraser tool.

4. **Clear Canvas** (Open palm): Extend all fingers and hold for 1-2 seconds to clear the entire canvas.

5. **Pause Drawing** (Closed fist): Close all fingers into a fist to temporarily stop drawing.

6. **Dual-Hand Drawing**: Use both hands with index fingers extended to draw with two points simultaneously.

For more detailed instructions on gestures, see the [Gesture Guide](GESTURE_GUIDE.md).

### Manual Controls

If you prefer not to use hand gestures or if hand tracking is unavailable, you can use:

- **Mouse**: Click and drag to draw on the canvas.
- **Touch**: On touch-enabled devices, use your finger to draw.

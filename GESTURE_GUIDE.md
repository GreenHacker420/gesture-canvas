## Tips for Better Gesture Recognition

1. **Good Lighting**: Ensure your hands are well-lit for better detection.

2. **Camera Position**: Position your webcam to capture your hands clearly.

3. **Hand Distance**: Keep your hands at an optimal distance from the camera (approximately 1-2 feet).

4. **Clear Background**: A simple, uncluttered background helps with hand detection.

5. **Deliberate Gestures**: Make clear, deliberate hand positions for better recognition.

6. **Camera Quality**: Higher resolution webcams provide better tracking accuracy.

7. **Hand Position**: Face your palm toward the camera for optimal landmark detection.

## Troubleshooting

### Hand Not Detected
- Check your lighting conditions
- Make sure your hand is within the camera frame
- Try moving closer to or further from the camera
- Restart the application if problems persist

### Gestures Not Recognized Correctly
- Make more deliberate, clear hand positions
- Ensure all fingers are clearly visible to the camera
- Check that no fingers are partially hidden or overlapping

### Erratic Drawing
- Stabilize your hand
- Move more slowly for better tracking
- Check for reflective surfaces or bright lights in the background

## Fallback Controls

If hand tracking is unavailable or not working well, you can still use the application with:

- **Mouse**: Click and drag to draw
- **Touch**: Use your finger on touch-enabled devices
- **Manual Controls**: Use the UI buttons for color selection, brush size, and clearing the canvas

# About Gesture Canvas Art Stream

## Project Overview

Gesture Canvas Art Stream is an interactive web application that allows users to create digital art using hand gestures captured through their webcam. The application uses advanced computer vision techniques to track hand movements and translate them into drawing actions on a digital canvas.

## How It Works

The application uses TensorFlow.js and MediaPipe to detect and track hand movements in real-time. Here's how the technology works:

1. **Hand Detection**: The webcam feed is processed using TensorFlow.js and MediaPipe's hand pose detection models to identify hands in the frame.

2. **Landmark Tracking**: Once hands are detected, the application tracks 21 key points (landmarks) on each hand, including fingertips, knuckles, and the wrist.

3. **Gesture Recognition**: Based on the relative positions of these landmarks, the application recognizes specific gestures:
   - Index finger extended = Drawing mode
   - Thumb and index finger pinched = Color selection
   - Open palm = Eraser
   - Closed fist = Clear canvas

4. **Canvas Interaction**: The recognized gestures are translated into drawing actions on the HTML5 Canvas element, allowing users to create digital art without touching their device.

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend Components

- **Canvas Panel**: Manages the drawing surface and rendering of strokes
- **Camera Panel**: Handles webcam access and displays the video feed
- **Gesture Handler**: Processes hand tracking data and converts it to drawing commands
- **Drawing Context**: Manages the application state including current tool, color, and canvas history

### Hand Tracking Implementation

The application uses a dual-approach to hand tracking:

1. **Primary Method**: TensorFlow.js with the HandPose model for accurate tracking
2. **Fallback Method**: MediaPipe runtime when TensorFlow.js is not available or encounters issues

This ensures compatibility across different browsers and devices, providing a consistent experience for all users.

### Performance Optimizations

- **Throttled Rendering**: Limits the frame rate of hand tracking to maintain smooth performance
- **Chunked Processing**: Processes video frames in chunks to prevent UI blocking
- **Lazy Loading**: Loads the hand tracking models only when needed
- **Asset Compression**: Uses compression for faster loading of application assets

## Deployment Options

The application is designed to be deployed on multiple platforms:

### GitHub Pages

The primary deployment platform, offering free hosting for the application. The deployment is configured through GitHub Actions for automatic updates whenever changes are pushed to the main branch.

### Vercel

Offers improved performance through its global CDN and edge functions. The application includes specific configurations for Vercel to handle WebAssembly files and CORS settings properly.

### Netlify

Provides another reliable hosting option with continuous deployment. The application includes a custom Netlify plugin to handle MediaPipe dependencies correctly.

## Browser Compatibility

The application works best on modern browsers that support:
- WebGL for TensorFlow.js
- WebAssembly for MediaPipe
- getUserMedia API for webcam access

Recommended browsers:
- Chrome (latest)
- Firefox (latest)
- Edge (latest)
- Safari 14+

## Future Development

Planned features for future releases:
- Additional drawing tools and effects
- Improved gesture recognition accuracy
- Gallery to save and share creations
- Collaborative drawing mode
- Mobile-optimized experience
